# Project Description:

In this project, we engage with the BDshape dataset, a collection of binary shapes representing various object classes. The dataset presents complexities such as occluded shapes, partial representations, distortions, and heterogeneous shapes within classes. Each shape is stored as a binary image in the format SxxNyyy.pgm, where Sxx denotes the class number and Nyyy denotes the sample number within the class.

To tackle the task, we implement several classification methods, including the supervised K-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach, the unsupervised K-means clustering, and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.

Throughout the project, we conduct various tests and evaluations to assess the performance of the implemented models. These evaluations include analyzing confusion matrices, precision/recall metrics, and computational time to provide comprehensive insights into the strengths and limitations of each method.
